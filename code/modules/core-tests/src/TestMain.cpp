// TODO: Make log & assertions in code work with tests - this can probably be done using a custom main function

#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN
#include "catch.hpp"
// Test classes don't need to be included here, catch will link them automatically
// Do not write tests in this class, otherwise compile times will be slower!
