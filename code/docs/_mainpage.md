\mainpage Modulith Engine Documentation

**Welcome to the documentation for the Modulith Engine**

In this documentation, the Modulith Engine, Modulith Runtime and the core modules (Core, Renderer, Physics, Editor) are documented.
There are pages for each of the public headers, as well as a couple of API documentation and technical documents, introduced below.

If you want to get started right away writing a module, refer to the \ref quickstart "Quickstart" documentation.
For a complete walkthrough the Engine's base features and how to use them for gameplay, refer to \ref vertical_slice "the vertical slice walkthrough".

Both of the main systems of this engine, the \ref module_api "Module System" and the \ref ecs_api "Entity Component System (ECS)" (that is part of the Core module) are also documented on their own pages.
They also both have a more detailed technical documentation (\ref ecs_specs "ECS", \ref module_specs "Module System")

Furthermore, the API documentation for each of the core modules can found here: \ref core_api "Core" \ref renderer_api "Renderer", \ref physics_api "Physics" and \ref editor_api "Editor".

Lastly, some information about the game & mod modules can be found here: \ref game_docs "Game", \ref shooter_docs "Shooter" and \ref mario_docs "Mario".
